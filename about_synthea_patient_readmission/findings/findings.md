## 🔍 ***Key Findings from the Analysis***

> ### 🏥 ***Encounter & Care Characteristics***

- **`UrgentCare` and `Ambulatory` encounters** show the **highest readmission risk** compared to other encounter classes.

- **Encounters lasting `more than 30 minutes`** are associated with a **significantly higher likelihood of readmission**.

- **`Higher utilization` levels** consistently correspond to **increased readmission risk**, indicating repeated or intensive care patterns.

---

> ### 💊 ***Medication & Cost Factors***

- **`Short medication duration` (< 3 months)** is strongly associated with **higher readmission**.

- **`Lower total medication cost` (< 727)** shows a **higher readmission rate**, suggesting limited treatment exposure.

- **`Procedure costs above 1610`** are linked to **elevated readmission risk**.

- **`Very low (1–7) and very high (≥264) base medicine costs`** exhibit higher readmission compared to mid-range costs.

---

> ### 👥 ***Demographic & Socioeconomic Factors***

- **`Single` patients** experience **higher readmission rates** than other marital groups.

- **`Black` and `Native` patients** show a **higher likelihood of readmission** relative to other racial groups.

- **`Male` patients** have a **slightly higher readmission risk** than female patients.

- Encounters treated by **`female providers`** show **marginally higher readmission rates**.

- **Age groups `19–50, 59–65,` and `80+`** demonstrate **elevated readmission risk**.

- **`Coverage ratios below 70%`** are associated with **higher readmission probability**.

### 🧠 Summary Insight
> Readmission risk is primarily driven by encounter intensity and treatment continuity, while demographic and coverage factors play a secondary role.
